Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing "Not answerable".  Plot title: The Frozen North Movie plot: The film opens near the "last stop on the subway", a terminal in Alaska, which appears to be emerging from deep snow in the middle of nowhere. A tough-looking cowboy (Buster Keaton) emerges. He arrives at a small settlement, finding people gambling in a saloon. He tries to rob them by scaring them with the cutout of a poster of a man holding a gun, which he places at the window, as if it is he is an accomplice. He tells the gamblers to raise their hands in the air. Frightened, they hand over their cash, but soon they find out the truth when a drunk man falls over the cutout. Keaton is thrown out through the window.     Keaton offers flowers to his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). Next, he mistakenly enters a house thinking that it is his own house. Inside, he sees a man and a woman kissing. Thinking the woman is his wife, he gets red-hot angry and shoots the couple, later to realize his mistake. He goes to his own house, where he finds his wife (Sybil Seely), who greets him, but he treats her coldly. She tries to pick a vase from a shelf, but it drops and knocks her out. Investigating the shooting of the couple, a passing policeman then knocks at Keaton's door after hearing his wife scream. Keaton saves himself from arrest by playing music on gramophone and pretending to dance with his unconscious wife. As soon as the officer leaves, he drops her on the floor. He looks out of the window and sees his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). He quickly dons an elegant white suit and picks flowers (mysteriously growing from the deep snow-a sign remarks "Keep Off the Grass"). He attempts to woo her, but she rejects him. Her husband comes back home and Keaton's character has to flee once more. The neighbors leave on a sled for a new, even more bleak northerly location. Keaton gets a "car" (a dog sled with an engine) driven by a friend (Joe Roberts) to follow them, but it breaks down, so he has to hail a passing "taxi" (a horse drawn sled with upholstery).

Given the question: What type of details about robert ridder -lrb- politician -rrb-  can be gathered from the following bio?  Bio: robert c. ridder -lrb- born february 25 , 1927 -rrb- is an american former politician in the state of washington . ridder served in the washington state senate as a democrat from the 35th district from 1966 to 1973 . he attended the university of washington and earned a bachelor of science degree , and completed graduate studies . he was later an educator , serving as a vice principal of a junior high school . he retired from his senate seat in 1973 and was succeeded by his wife , ruthe .
The answer is:

Generated Response:
He graduated with honors from Washington University, Seattle, Wash., where he majored in biology.  He then became involved in politics.
What I did not understand was that it would give me all possible answers.

A:

I think this is one of those cases where you want to use regexps for most things rather than brute-forcing through every possibility. 
You know there are only two types of names (given name & surname) so let's start searching with a simple regular expression
([A-Z]\w+|[\w]+)

This will match any combination of:

A letter followed by anything upto 2 words OR 
Any word (including letters)
No characters at all - which we don't need. 

So if your data contains 'Robert Ridder' or 'Robert Riddell', we'll get both matches because they contain 'American politician' but not 'Michigan politician'.
If there's something else you're looking for: 

It looks like it's likely going to have some whitespace between the first and last character of each phrase. (which could also mean it's just part of one big string) 
It's probably better to split on spaces rather than punctuation marks.  

To make this more efficient I'd suggest storing them separately before matching, since you'll be needing to check whether they're valid strings in order to determine their position within the overall text.
Also, how do you expect people to enter these?

Reference Response:
From the given bio, the following details about Robert Ridder can be gathered:

1. He was born on February 25, 1927.
2. He is an American politician who served in the Washington State Senate as a Democrat from the 35th district from 1966 to 1973.
3. He attended the University of Washington and earned a Bachelor of Science degree.
4. He completed graduate studies.
5. He was an educator and served as a vice principal of a junior high school.
6. He retired from his senate seat in 1973.
7. His wife, Ruthe, succeeded him in the senate seat.

C.

What is the difference between a predator and an ecosystem?
Which of the following statements about ecosystems are true?

Ecosystems can be used as models for human society.
An ecosystem supports many species in ways that support life on Earth.
The world’s biodiversity depends upon functioning ecosystems.
If we destroy one part of an ecosystem, then it may not function correctly.  What do you think will happen to other parts of the system?  How might this affect humans’ lives?

A:

You should look at Ecology 101. It's basically the study of how organisms interact with each other within their environment. 
This question has been asked before here (here) but I would suggest using that site more than trying to find it yourself because it's easier when someone else already found it. 

A:

For what its worth, my answer is based off of Wikipedia's entry on Ecosystems.
As others have stated, any given organism interacts with its environment through several different mechanisms such as parasitism or symbiosis.
A predation event happens if there exists some type of interaction between two individuals which results in the death of one individual.  
So while parasites, etc., could result from a predatory relationship between two individuals, they don't necessarily require a direct killing action by either partner.

Reference Response:
Predators control prey population.

The Serpentine Sackler Gallery: 'A wedding marquee battling a stiff breeze'

Kensington Gardens is no stranger to the white pointed peaks of temporary tents, every year seeing elaborate marquees poke above the trees for summer events. But now the west London park has the deluxe marquee to end all marquees: the rippling rooftop of the £14.5m Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid, which opens to the public on Saturday.

Dipping and diving in sinuous waves, the white canopy is a new permanent extension to the Royal Park's Magazine, a former 1805 gunpowder store, five minutes' walk from the existing Serpentine Gallery on the north side of the Serpentine Bridge. It does what marquees usually do, housing the catering facilities for the new gallery space – only here, tea and biscuits are supplanted by a 120-seat restaurant as souped-up as the architecture, which will be run by German celebrity sushi chef Oliver Lange.

Like a wedding marquee battling with a stiff breeze, the structure billows and eddies, swooping down to meet the ground at three points along its perimeter, before shooting up again in improbable gymnastic leaps. It is not quite clear what function all this overwrought writhing serves.

"It is one of the most complicated structures we have worked on in the office," says project architect Fabian Hecker, describing the lengthy process of "form finding" with three sets of engineers to "push the limits of what the material can do".

Hadid, a long-serving trustee of the Serpentine, designed the first of the gallery's annual temporary pavilions in 2000, and was again hired to build a canopy of PVC mushrooms in 2007. The Sackler building continues her ongoing pursuit of tensile structures, this time made of PTFE-coated glass fibre fabric (as used for the Millennium Dome), stretched between a twisting roller-coaster steel frame. Its edge is clad with a clunky fibreglass trim that juts out sharply like the peak of an Ascot hat, looming clumsily over the fine Georgian brickwork of the Magazine.

Designing a building where the roof meets the floor in one continuous surface means you see things that would otherwise be hidden – the unfortunate result here being an edge of crumpled fabric, stuffed unceremoniously behind the gutter. It has the crudeness expected of the gallery's summer pavilion, not a multi-million pound permanent home.

Entering the building feels like being swept under the voluminous swirling petticoats of a Toulouse-Lautrec dancer, although the lightness you would imagine from a floaty tent is strangely absent. Instead, the opaque roof feels heavy and smothering, hanging low over the curved glass wall that runs around the edge of the space, so you can't really see the surrounding park at all.

The ceiling is held aloft on five soaring steel columns that puncture the open-plan room like great urinals, each rising to an ovular opening that funnels light down their concave shafts. Dotted with a kitchen pod and cantilevered bar in wipe-clean whiteness, the whole place has the look of a space-age sanitary wares showroom, a slightly naff prelude to what lies beyond.

The understated star of the show is the gunpowder store itself, open to the public for the first time in the building's 208-year history, now converted into a series of gallery spaces with the help of conservation architect Liam O'Connor. Most recently used to store the Mall's flagpoles, the building is what Hecker describes as a "house within a house," the 1805 store enclosed by outer walls in the 1860s, with a Palladian portico added on the front in the 1920s.

Subtle acts of surgery have now stitched the pieces together, forming a layered sequence that echoes the classical form of the existing Serpentine Gallery across the lake. A top-lit ambulatory gallery wraps around the central store, lined with plasterboard walls, providing a jacket to the inner sanctum of the two brick barrel-vaulted gunpowder chambers, dimly-lit and grotto-like spaces left raw, with exposed beams overhead. A northern wing of services and staff offices has also been added to the building, in the same Georgian dress as the original.

Not that much of this can be seen for now, as the artist of the opening show, Argentinian Adrián Villar Rojas, has shrouded the interior with a brilliant installation that transforms the space with a new sculpted facade. Featuring cracked clay walls and a floor of loose-laid bricks, the piece has an earthy quality that engages with the building's own history and materiality, throwing into relief the starched white prissiness of what stands next door. It also includes a gigantic clay elephant charging head-first at the crumbling building – an apt metaphor, perhaps, for the architect's approach.
What are the most important parts of this text?

Generated Response:
a row of shelves.
Hecker says: "We didn't want it looking too cool or high-tech; rather more organic, almost rustic-looking, because it's outside, so there should be some warmth around the edges."
A similar problem besets the internal spaces: the walls of corrugated metal create a stark contrast against the light-coloured wood floors below them, but they also reflect the sun off the glazed ceiling tiles into windows that overlook Kensington Palace and Hyde Park Corner.

On the other hand, the large window-filled atrium provides plenty of natural daylight through the slats of the facade's translucent plastic panels, while allowing sunlight to filter through the room itself when the canopy is open.

"I think it's very cleverly done to integrate both the modern materials and the traditional feel within this unusual setting," says Julian Leigh, head of design at CCA Architects who helped to draw up plans for the interior. "It really brings back memories of 19th-century art galleries."

In spite of these minor problems, many visitors were pleased to discover such openness beneath their feet.

"What I love about the way they've brought nature inside is how beautiful everything looks even if you've got your glasses on! It's great to look across the garden and get a sense of what's going on underneath," said visitor Anne Barker, 62 years old, wearing sunglasses and carrying two small children in tow.

But for those who prefer indoor environments, there are still plenty of opportunities to marvel at the architecture without getting wet.

"It's wonderful to experience something that's contemporary yet somehow manages to evoke the feeling of history," says another visitor, Matthew Taylor, 28, visiting his parents.

Visitors entering via a nearby footpath will soon realise that although much has been changed since the magazine opened 25 years ago, the main entrance hall remains just as grand.

"We don't know whether people remember this place or what they saw in 2001, but hopefully they'll enjoy the freshness of the current exhibition," said museum director David Adjaye, speaking from inside the huge concrete box-like lobby, whose central pillar contains the sculpture Three Tones, by artist Diederik Vermeer.
Adjaye says he hopes the new addition makes "the entire complex more accessible" and encourages visitors "to come along and take advantage of our free tours", which reveal little-known stories behind the buildings and gardens.

One such story concerns a stone archway built onto the site by Queen Victoria herself during construction of the palace grounds

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What are most people trying to do when going on vacation? Possible A: panic, debate, having fun, debt, peace  Why is "having fun" an answer aligned with human common sense?
Answer:

Generated Response:
because it comes from the same source as "peace."  
Q2: I know there was this discussion about being able to define "pleasure" but I can't seem to find that post.  Can you please help me understand what exactly pleasures means in philosophy?  Thanks for your time!
A: It's not clear if pleasure can be defined (you said you couldn't), so I'll try to describe it:

Pleasure = desire + satisfaction  

The definition of "desire" depends on which theory you're using.
To say something like "the desire to go to Paris or Rome is satisfied by my trip there" would use the idea of "satisfaction" without further explanation.  
Satisfaction could mean some physical thing such as:
"I am happy to have seen those beautiful buildings, and I'm glad I've eaten at the best restaurant ever!" 
But more generally, satisfaction has two meanings; 

A good feeling after accomplishing something: "I feel contented now because I've finished writing up all these papers today."  
An experience that makes one want to repeat itself.

You may wonder why things we enjoy don't make us feel good - that's because they aren't necessarily positive. 
For instance, while eating delicious food might give you happiness,  you also get hungry afterwards and then you'll probably end up complaining about how much you've had to eat. 
So the reason it's called "happiness" isn't just because it's pleasant; it's because its effects last longer than other experiences.  

A:

This seems pretty straightforward. The basic meaning is: A state where someone feels good/bad/middle-ground/whatever based on their current position.
That doesn't mean any particular activity will always lead to that state -- though activities that generate excitement tend towards creating joyous states. (As opposed to stressing out over work.)
In terms of practical applications, perhaps happiness is simply a term for making sure everyone's doing well enough to stay around long enough to enjoy themselves.

Reference Response:
"Having fun" is aligned with human common sense as it is a well-known fact that people usually go on vacation to relax, unwind, and enjoy themselves. Vacations are often seen as a break from the daily routine and a chance to engage in activities that bring joy and happiness. Therefore, "having fun" is a logical answer that aligns with the common reason why people go on vacation.

Obesity has quickly become a major health issue in Texas. In 2017, 33.6% of Texas adults were obese as compared to 29.9% of U.S. adults. In 2000 21.7% of adults were obese and in 1990 only 10.7% of adults were obese. In 2016, 33% of 10-17 year olds in Texas were obese. When separated out by gender, 34.6% of Texas females and 32.8% of Texas males were obese. When separated out by race, 31% of White adults, 41.7% of Black adults, and 37.8% of Hispanic adults were obese in Texas in 2016.Research shows that an increase in household income is correlated with a decrease in obesity rates. There are educational achievement patterns as well - 39% of the Texas population with less than a high school education was obese while only 23% of college graduates were obese. Living in a rural area in Texas is also correlated with higher obesity rates.
Answer this question: How many more percent of Hispanic adults were obese than White adults?

Generated Response:
What would be your guess?
When looking at all three categories together (race, ethnicity & gender), there seems to be no significant difference between obesity levels for different groups within these groups.
The number one factor associated with increased prevalence of childhood overweight or obesity is maternal BMI. Researchers have found that:
In 2015, 1.4 million children under 5 years old had some form of obesity (obtained from CDC website)
From 2004-2015, the percentage of infants who were considered “overweight” or “obese” increased significantly among both African American and non-Hispanic white children. This represents about 13% increases overall since 2005. (from The Obesity Society Website)

Reference Response:
In 2016, 37.8% of Hispanic adults were obese in Texas, while 31% of White adults were obese. Therefore, the percentage of Hispanic adults who were obese was 6.8% higher than the percentage of White adults who were obese.

The author makes use of irony throughout the piece. He starts off by saying that although the book doesn't tell us everything that's happened before Christmas Eve,we know enough to be able to put ourselves in the shoes of Santa Claus' elves.He then goes onto discuss the problems faced when trying to find out where Santa lives -which is clearly going against the spirit of Christmas! Finally,he ends by comparing the modern world to the old days when Santa lived amongst children and gave gifts every day of the year.All these issues together demonstrate both the author's sarcasm and the author's criticism towards today's society which puts too much emphasis on materialistic values rather than spiritual ones.
This paragraph discusses how hard it is for our parents today to keep up with technology compared to those in years gone by.

What were the causes of the Dust Bowl and how did it affect the population of the state of Oklahoma?

The passage describes how poor farming practices, extended drought, and high winds led to the Dust Bowl in parts of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, and northwestern Oklahoma during the 1930s. This resulted in long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, which caused thousands of farmers to fall into poverty and forced them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. As a result, the state of Oklahoma saw its only historical decline in population over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Therefore, the question asks about the causes of the Dust Bowl and how it affected the population of the state of Oklahoma.

Given the question: Given the below context:  The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter. Meanwhile, Andre falls for a pretty gardener, Angelique who presents him with the world of equal rights for all people.  Guess a valid title for it!
The answer is:

Generated Response:
This book begins when Thibaut returns from the future to 19th Century Paris and meets a woman called Juliette whom he thought would be dead and now lives near Les Invalides - Her mother died at age 50 due to cancer so that's why she's been living there.
Thibault tells her story:

"When I came home after my trip across the river, you were already gone! You had left on your honeymoon ... No one has ever told me this, but I know it because I saw you go away behind our house without looking back. 
I followed you until you entered a car, then I waited outside hoping you'd turn around again; nothing happened. I went inside the house, locked myself in my room, cried like crazy, took off my clothes, threw them onto the floor. Then I woke up, covered in sweat, cold. When I got dressed, I looked at you: still wearing your white dress.

Then he goes further down the memory lane...

Juliette's mother never married, so the whole estate belonged to her alone. And I loved her more every day... We'd sit together reading poetry, playing cards or talking nonsense. It seemed such fun!

Later, he visits their childhood home, in the countryside:

...we walked through fields full of daisies, violets and buttercups… I remember how we always used to run barefoot through those flowers, feeling them between our feet...
We climbed over hedges to get closer to wild birds, we sat beside brooks listening to their voices, watching swans float slowly above us…
And sometimes we'd stay awake late and watch stars twinkle in the sky, count them and dream of what we could do if only we could see things clearly again. But even though we did everything possible, something kept happening to keep us apart forever. 

They finally meet each other once again in their hometowns: 

In our old village, a statue of Christ stood guard at the church gate. On Sundays, we both liked to walk to Mass, but not many people knew how long it really took, especially since everyone else preferred to read a magazine or play video games rather than pray. 
On Christmas Eve, we often played Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus, pretending to bring gifts to children whose parents didn't have enough money to buy toys. One year, someone asked us what we wanted most, and we said that we wished our mothers could visit us too – it's hard being separated all these years. That night, Mom arrived just like any other

pick from the following.
(A). Yes.
(B). No.
Answer:

Generated Response:
(C) I don't know

A:

(A) The hypothalamus controls appetite and satiety.  Pituitary secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone will increase or decrease body metabolism. These changes in metabolic rate would result in weight gain or loss as needed based on energy needs.
(B)  Hypothalamic control of food intake through neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, ghrelin, leptin, etc.), which regulate feeding behavior are not affected by a deficiency of any other hormonal system.
(C)  It depends where your focus lies; if it is anorexia nervosa, then yes. If it's overweight/obesity, no.

Should I validate this answer?
A:

Generated Response:
Yes.
B: No.
C: Maybe.

I'm not sure why B was chosen as incorrect. 
I've also seen other questions where the correct answer had been marked down with "wrong" but it seems that some people would rather say something along these lines than just mark them wrong:

How can we avoid getting stuck on incorrect (but understandable) results when using NLTK? This question shows how the same process works differently depending upon whether you are validating or debugging your own work. 

Why do they make this distinction?

A:

If you ask me correctly - yes!
You should validate answers of automated systems! It doesn´t matter if there´s no human being behind such a validation or not; even though most of time there will be no human looking at it. 
Now, you have two possibilities here: 

The user answered correctly BUT he used only 1 word which means he made mistake somewhere else (in grammar, synonyms etc.). So, you need to find out what his mistakes were before passing him any feedback about the fact that his answer didn´t pass the verification phase. 
He gave completely correct answer which passed all checks and went through the whole verification process without error. In case of this scenario, please don´t tell anyone anything about it unless the user explicitly asks you so. (In my opinion, it´s very rare.)

Reference Response:
Yes, validate the answer but also provide additional information for better understanding: Vitamin A is essential for maintaining good vision, supporting immune system function, and aiding in growth and development. Beta-cryptoxanthin, a carotenoid with vitamin activity, contributes to fulfilling Vitamin A requirements in humans.

What are all possible questions one can ask about an animal in this situation?

A:

The problem with asking "What do they eat? What does it look like? Where did you find it? How long has it been there?  Why isn't it doing anything?"  You get very little information. The first thing I would suggest looking for is photos or videos of the species (and it's habitat). If you can't get any video then at least try and photograph its environment.

Alfalfa Switzer, Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, "The Blur", in the upcoming Soap Box Derby go-kart race. However, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found. The boys go to find Alfalfa and discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla, with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl, which goes against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans. At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date (whoopee cushion, cat litter in sandwiches, etc.). When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which leads her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down. Darla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions towards Waldo, the new kid in town whose father is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, he is assigned by Stymie to guard the go-kart until the day of the race.  answer the following question:  Who is the He-Man Woman Haters Club driver found with?

Definition: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.
Input: Passage: In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, "Jugband Blues". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", "Let There Be More Light" and "Corporal Clegg". Wright composed "See-Saw" and "Remember a Day". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on "Remember a Day", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, "Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking "like an architectural diagram".Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to "forget it as background music to a party". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as "like a religious experience", while NME described the song as "long and boring ... [with] little to warrant its monotonous direction". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park. In July 1968, they returned to the US for a second visit. Accompanied by the Soft Machine and the Who, it marked Pink Floyd's first significant tour. In December of that year, they released "Point Me at the Sky"; no more successful than the two singles they had released since "See Emily Play", it would be the band's last until their 1973 release, "Money". 
Question: What are the names of the two individuals whose method was later described as looking "like an architectural diagram"?
Output:

Generated Response:
, the group released a box set containing three previously unknown tracks from the albums Dark Side of the Moon (1967), Wish You Were Here (1969) and Animals (1977).

Reference Response:
The answer to the question is "Waters and Mason". In the passage, it is mentioned that neither Waters nor Mason could read music, and to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking "like an architectural diagram". Therefore, the names of the two individuals whose method was later described as looking "like an architectural diagram" are Waters and Mason.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What does CFLs refer to? Context: Objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps. Some people have concerns about the health effects of fluorescent lamps. However, even though they contain mercury, the environmental performance of CFLs is much better than that of light bulbs, mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production. LED lamps are even more efficient, and are free of mercury. They are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness.
The answer is:

Generated Response:
(1) The term "fluorescent lamps" refers to a type of lighting technology where ultraviolet radiation passes through an organic substance called a phosphor. This substance absorbs some of this UV radiation. (2) Light emitting diodes produce light by applying electricity directly to semiconductors, which can be made with gallium nitride or other materials. (3) A carbon-fiber-glass-lamp has many advantages over traditional light sources such as compact size, high brightness, long lifetime and low operating costs.
(4) There are two types of carbon fiber-glass lights available - linear and circular - but both require very precise manufacturing techniques.
(5) Linear carbon fibers were used for the first time at NASA's Johnson Space Center during the Apollo program in 1969; however, since then it was only until 1990 when the company General Electric introduced their linear-carbon-filament filament into commercial applications.

Given the following passage  "A tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is 1 in × 1 in (25 mm × 25 mm), as for example, on the floor of the University of Toronto pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in (51 mm × 51 mm) are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What do these projections usually show?
The answer to this question is:

Generated Response:
A map of the world.
How can we know this? We look at the answers given to similar questions, like this one:
What does a "map projection" mean?

A:

You don't have to be an expert to see what it means - just looking at your examples you would say something along the lines of:

A map shows where things are located. 
Maps project data onto a surface.

And then if you want more details you'd say: 

For example, satellite maps are projected so that they fit inside
  Earth's atmosphere; aerial photographs are projected so that they're not distorted while airborne. 

So basically it's projecting coordinates (as points) onto surfaces/lines/surfaces etc which could be 2D/3D.

These projections usually show text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Jordan held back tears because they didn't want to show any emotion in public.  Given the context: How would you describe Jordan?
A:

Generated Response:
Strong, determined (the person is not afraid of showing emotions)
B: Emotional but controlled (they are able to control their feelings.)
C: Tears rolling down her cheeks.

Reference Response:
Based on the given context, Jordan can be described as someone who is proud and emotional, but also upset. Jordan's reluctance to show any emotion in public suggests that they may have a strong sense of pride and a desire to maintain a certain level of composure in front of others. However, the fact that Jordan is holding back tears also indicates that they are feeling emotional and upset about something. This suggests that Jordan is someone who is deeply affected by their emotions and may struggle to keep them in check at times. Overall, Jordan appears to be a complex and multi-faceted individual who is capable of experiencing a wide range of emotions.

Please answer the following question: Ben and Harry were studying about the climatic history of Earth. Ben was more attracted to learning about early Ice Ages, while Harry was curious about the Earth atmosphere and read about ozone depletion and its consequences.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person learned less about the size of the ozone hole over Antarctica?  Hint: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels.
A:

Generated Response:
Harry
B:Ben

What do you think?

A:

I would say it depends on what your definition of 'less' means. If we define it by "one knows something better than another" then yes I would say it's B because he has studied things which are more important for his career (and therefore likely to be published) whereas A studies topics not so relevant. 
But if we look at how much they both know - even though each one knows some things better than the other, there aren't enough differences between them that there's any way to tell who's knowledge is greater without knowing all the details. For example, both can talk about climate change but only one of them can explain why certain changes happened rather than others. 

A:

I believe this question is asking us to choose who did more researching or study based off information given.  
In my opinion this isn't an easy task to solve.  
However, it seems like our professor gave two possible answers:  

A student knows more facts
B does more reading.  

Based on these examples I feel the correct answer should be:  
B did more researching.

The reasoning behind this decision is: 
When asked "Ben and Harry were studying...", our teacher doesn't mean "A was studying..." and "Harry was studying...". Instead she wants us to pick out 1 thing from those 2 people that was different.   
Therefore, when she said "I'll give you 10 points for saying 'Ben knew more facts'" her meaning is "A didn't spend time doing anything else besides just thinking up new facts to add to his books" since he simply wasn't spending time doing any kind of independent study.   However, "B" spent his free time actively looking into stuff outside of books.  
Therefore, "A"'s lackluster performance here makes him appear lazy and/or unmotivated compared to someone who actually takes initiative.   

A:

If we take Ben as a reference point, then he might have been able to learn more by getting involved in extra-curricular activities such as clubs and extracurricular classes, instead of taking lessons during school hours. He could also go through old textbooks left over after class ends to find additional material. 
On the contrary, Harry probably chose to focus his attention mainly on his own hobbies and interests, leaving very little room for extra homework assignments. This approach worked fine until recently due to limited resources and lower pollution rates; however now scientists have started acknowledging the seriousness of global warming effects caused by human activity.

Reference Response:
The paragraph does not provide information about which person learned less about the size of the ozone hole over Antarctica.

There are only so many squats and lunges you can do before you want to run away and then realise you ca n't because your legs have actually turned to jelly . It was only when I was in the shower afterwards that I realised why I had been resisting the gym . For a split second while I was under the water , I started to plan my evening in my head , which included going " home " to my ex .

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What sport am I doing ?

Generated Response:
a. Running

b. Squatting

c. Swimming 

d. Basketball  

A:

It depends.
If you're asking what sports you can do at an indoor gymnasium like this one,

You can't play basketball as there is no court. 
Running is possible but it won't be very efficient for a short distance since the incline of the ground makes running uphill more difficult than walking downhill.

So if you ask whether or not it's okay to go outdoors with friends who aren't athletes, yes, it's fine.  If they are already athletic, however, don't invite them unless they're willing to train with you first - that's better for their health (and yours) anyway. 

A:

Depends how active you are. You would probably get bored quickly by playing tennis inside, especially if you are new to the game. But you could still enjoy volleyball outside, golf, skating, hockey etc

Reference Response:
Based on the given passage, it is not explicitly mentioned what sport or exercise the person is doing. However, it can be inferred that the person is doing a workout that involves squats and lunges, which suggests that they might be doing a strength training or weightlifting exercise. The passage also suggests that the person is not enjoying the workout and is finding it difficult to continue.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?
If you’re doing your best to allow him to notice you but he still isn’t getting the hint, you can always speed things up a bit and simply tell him how you feel. If you’re not very comfortable confessing your feelings to him, you can do so more casually by saying something such as, “I’ve had so much fun hanging out with you lately. I really like spending time with you.” You can then see how he responds. Maybe he feels the same way, but wasn’t sure how to bring it up. A girl can only wait so long! If he still isn’t noticing you, try making the move yourself. If you feel confident asking him out on a date, go for it! If you’re not ready to formally ask him out, you could try something more easygoing by saying something like, “A few of my friends are going to see a movie this weekend. Would you like to join us?” This takes the pressure off, yet still allows a chance for you to spend more time with him. If he agrees to go, make the most of it and try to show your interest and get to know him better. whether he notices you or not. If you go through these steps and he still isn’t taking notice, it’s time to move on. There are plenty of other guys out there. Make sure you are content regardless of who notices you. Your happiness is your responsibility. When you are happy and confident, even if the guy you like doesn’t notice you, the right person will someday.  A good way to practice contentment is to count your blessings. It can be challenging when you don't get what you want, but you still have a lot of other great things and people in your life. Make the most of what you have right now instead of waiting for something in the future. Then when you finally do find the right person, you will be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. If you are struggling with this, try making a list of all the great people and things in your life. Instead of dwelling on the one person who doesn't notice you, take notice of each person who cherishes you and spend time with them. They will help you get past your disappointment. Try to practice positive thinking instead of allowing negativity to cloud your mind. Replace thoughts like, "I feel awful that he doesn't like me. Why does this always happen to me? I'm never going to find someone!" with, "I have such an amazing friend who does notice me. I'm so fortunate for what I have. We always have a great time together." This will help you to appreciate what you have instead of dwelling on what you don't have.

How many times has it happened to you: you're standing next to the tallest building in New York City (or wherever), looking down into the glassy waters below; it's beautiful - until a large black fish suddenly leaps from its hiding place and starts swimming toward you. In an instant, you've been flung back against the sidewalk - maybe several feet away - while a line of tourists watch helplessly as their tourist guide looks around frantically for his cell phone. For those lucky enough to witness the spectacle unfold before their eyes, they often describe the experience as being almost surreal:
The sudden flash of light sends shockwaves through every nerve ending within our bodies. Our heart races, our breath quickens, and our stomach churns; we've seen sharks too close once already for comfort, but here they're nearly underfoot and there's nothing anyone can do except stare and hope no harm comes to them. The shark's movement becomes less erratic after a moment, and the maneuver seems to settle into a pattern -- zigzagging forward, looping back, sinking further into the water. The crowd breaks apart, and some begin running towards the beach, trying desperately to escape.

Reference Response:
The article provides advice for girls who are trying to get a guy to notice them, including confessing their feelings, making a move, and practicing contentment if the guy still doesn't take notice.

Give the rationale and then the answer. Claim: "Saturday Night Live will have a different host on the next show."
Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?
Options:
- yes
- no

Generated Response:
A:

The problem is that this question asks whether or not something is true.
I would say no.

Claim: Saturday Night Live has changed its format for the upcoming episode (it was announced before the season started)
Reasoning: Because they did announce an update to their format in advance of the new season starting. (This is how most news stories are reported.)
Verification: If you go back far enough in history you'll find plenty of examples where the same thing happened at exactly the right time. 
For example,

On June 3, 2015 President Obama gave his State of the Union address.
In 2016 he said "we'll meet again soon!" when announcing he wouldn't run for president again after 8 years in office. 

These two things were both true at precisely the exact moment they occurred.  

There may also be other cases such as  

People usually expect certain events to happen.  For instance, if someone says "It's going to rain tomorrow" people typically assume that there isn't any chance that it's actually gonna rain.   
Some TV shows make changes over seasons.  
Even though one might think that all broadcasters change formats every year, some do stay with their current ones indefinitely.  On January 1, 2013 CBS replaced The Tonight Show with The Late Show.  (If you're interested, check out this article which explains why.)

However, these questions aren't about facts.  They ask about possible explanations; what could cause them?  To explain this situation I need to use more advanced logic.  In particular, I'm using a notion called 'precondition'.
Suppose we want to model 'Saturday night live does X'.  Then we'd like our definition to include 'X happens whenever SNL does Y'; so we should define something like:
Definition [SNL(X)]
  ::= 
    IF
      PROPERTY
        PROGRAM
          SNL
          ?Y
          (PROBLEM
            SNL
            ?X)
          (CONDITION
            (IF
              PROPERTY
                PROGRAMS
              (SELECTION
                  SNL
                 ?x
                  )
              )
            WHERE
              PROBLEMS
              (SELECTION
                    SNL
                     ?y
                      )
            )
          )
      )

Here we're defining SNL as a function from properties to problems.  It works because the way the property syntax works:
?prop1

Will evaluate prop1:
PROPERTIES
   {
    [[[[snl]]]]] = snl,
   }

and evaluate prop2:
PROBLEMS
   {
    [[[snl]]]]],
    [snl],
     [[[snl]]]],
  }

And finally evaluate snl:

Reference Response:
The claim cannot be verified by human common sense alone and without a web search. Therefore, the answer is "no".

Here are some examples of what you might get:
1) You can say that it has an excellent location on Main Street. 
2) It's close to the rainbow vegetarian café (near), but not too close. 

If it's nearby, I'd probably use something like "close by" or "near".
  If it's really close, then maybe just "towards" would be better.  But again,
  if you're describing how far away it is from somewhere else, that's more important than what's between them.  

3) This one depends mostly upon whether you've already mentioned any other restaurants around here; perhaps your description will contain only a short list of local favorites, so you'll want to include one with which it's similar.  
I think I've seen descriptions where the author didn't specify their favorite at all, but simply said "This place sells good food!"  
In such cases you'd need to find another way to describe its quality.   Sounds like a recipe book, right?  That'd work fine - even though there aren't many recipes included in books of this sort...

Student Performance
As indicated above, the participants were divided into three groups according to their proficiency levels: Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced levels. They took part in writing exercises based on the same texts but different tasks. Table 4 presents the average number of words produced during each task along with standard deviations and t-test results. As shown, intermediate learners produce significantly more words than beginners (p < 0.01). For advanced learners, no significant differences among tasks were found excepting Task 3 which yielded lower scores compared to other tasks. Therefore, these findings suggest that when confronted with complex discourse demands such as constructing extended narratives using multiple sources, beginning language learners tend to be less successful than intermediate ones who manage to maintain adequate production rates even though their output is not yet fluent.
Discussion and Conclusion
In line with previous studies investigating L2 learners' performance across various types of discourses, our study has focused specifically on students' narrative writings constructed within the scope of religious contexts. We aimed to investigate whether novice-level EFL writers would encounter difficulties in producing narratives involving diverse textual genres and/or discursive structures embedded in Christian mythological stories.
We found out that novices struggled greatly with narrative discourse construction regardless of its genre type. While several factors may contribute to the observed pattern including inadequate knowledge of linguistic resources required to encode different forms of representation used in narrative writing, we believe that insufficient fluency gained through limited exposure to similar kinds of communicative practices might be an important factor underlying the low overall productivity achieved by beginner writers.
Although considerable research efforts have been devoted over time to analyzing learners' problems with narrative writing, relatively few attempts have been made to understand why certain learner populations perform better than others despite having equivalent amounts of instructional input received.

To determine the category for "Enemy of God (album)", I will go through the list of categories and analyze if the title fits into any of them.

1. Company: Doesn't fit as it doesn't sound like a name or brand for a business.
2. Educational institution: Doesn't fit because it doesn't sound like the name of a school or college.
3. Artist: Doesn't fit, the title suggests it's something created by an artist but not the artist themselves.
4. Athlete: Doesn't fit, it's not a name or title for a sports person.
5. Office holder: Doesn't fit because it doesn't sound like a title for a government official or similar roles.
6. Mean of transportation: Doesn't fit because it doesn't sound like a vehicle or any other transportation method.
7. Building: Doesn't fit because it doesn't sound like the name of a structure or building.
8. Natural place: Doesn't fit, it's not a name for a geographical location or natural site.
9. Village: Doesn't fit because it doesn't sound like the name of a small settlement or community.
10. Animal: Doesn't fit because it doesn't sound like the name of a living organism belonging to the animal kingdom.
11. Plant: Doesn't fit, it's not a name for any living organism belonging to the plant kingdom.
12. Album: Fits! The title suggests it is a collection of musical recordings by an artist or band.
13. Film: Doesn't fit, as it was specified in the question that it's an album.
14. Written work: Doesn't fit because it's already identified as an album and not a book or any other written work.

After analyzing all categories, "Enemy of God (album)" fits best into the category of "Album". So,

Prompt:
If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass. 

Question: "As a fire burns, what stack slowly shrinks?"

Response: "The ashes"

Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Generated Response:
If so, why? 

A:

The answer lies in thermodynamics.
When we burn things (such as paper) they release heat energy which makes them hotter.  They become more dense because there are fewer atoms per unit volume.  (Remember the definition of density.)  So when combustion happens at room temperature, there's no change in total number of particles, but the average distance between particles gets smaller.  
However, when it's done under high temperatures like in an incinerator then we have lots of gas molecules making up some space that otherwise wouldn't exist.  When those molecules get cooled down again they will contract back towards eachother until they're close enough together for chemical reactions to happen - that's where they leave most of the ash behind.  

So basically what you're saying here is:  In combustion, even though we're heating stuff up without adding any new matter to it, we're actually taking away from its original state since less matter occupies the given volume.

But isn't this contradicting the laws of physics?

No, indeed!  
You might argue that when we burn food we don't add anything, yet we lose it through evaporation.   That's true, but let's suppose that instead of using food, we'd use alcohol (which has about twice the boiling point).  Now we'll evaporate half of our substance but make a lot more smoke while doing so. (It won't look much different visually...)

This is another good illustration of the fact that changing one thing requires changes elsewhere.  A piece of metal expands due to heat applied externally.  To keep itself intact, however, it needs to absorb the resulting expansion forces internally.   
There are many similar examples throughout chemistry & physics, such as:  

A glass container filled with liquid boils;   Expansion force pushes against walls of vessel,   therefore wall must expand to counteract pressure exerted on it;   Water inside rises.    
Water evaporates from a bottle placed in a darkened place,  Expansion force caused by higher temperature acts upon outside surface of bottle;   Outside surfaces of bottle need to shrink inwards;   Liquor inside falls.    
An object heats up;   Heat flow causes outer layer(s) to expand slightly relative to inner layers;   Outer shell becomes thicker than earlier;   Inner core contracts.      
In the case above, although both bottles expanded, only the first did so outwardly. 
Oil heated up in a pipe undergoes condensation, i.e., oil phase transitions to gas phase;   Condensations form bubbles within the fluid stream;   These bubbles grow and eventually reach the inner side of the tube, thus

Reference Response:
No, the response to the question is not factually correct. The stack of sticks and logs slowly shrinks as the fire burns, not the ashes. The ashes are what is left behind after the fire has burned out.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end):

Haliru Dantoro Kitoro III (1938 – October 30, 2015) was a Nigerian traditional ruler and politician. Dantoro became Emir of the Borgu, a Nigerian traditional state located in Niger State, on February 26, 2002, following the overthrown of his predecessor, Alhaji Isiaku Musa Jikantoro. Dantoro served as Emir until his death on October 28, 2015.

Sentence: Dantoro disliked Jikantoro.
Options are:
[-] Yes
[-] It's impossible to say
[-] No

Generated Response:
[+] Yes with qualification 
The answer has been written out below for your reference. 

A:

I would say that 

Dantoro disliked Jikantoro but it is difficult to tell whether he really did so or not.  

As you said,

it may be easy to know who likes whom because they often have many things in common; however when talking about political leaders one must always take into account their personalities and actions. 
  Also, there are very few people whose lives I can truly understand.   

So it's better to leave this up to an expert such as yourself. 
If you're looking for some good answers though, here are two:  

A lot depends on what kind of relationship these men had.
  If they were close friends then yes, we could conclude Dantoro hated Jikantoro.  
  However, since both had different goals, politics aside, 
  it seems like they rarely talked much about each other's family life,  
  which makes it harder to judge.  
On the other hand, if these two were rivals, then 

  One thing worth noting is that the title of emir is not hereditary and even if Dantoro liked Jikantoro, he didn't deserve to hold onto it forever.   

To me, the first case sounds more plausible.

Reference Response:
Option: It's impossible to say

Justification: The text does not provide any information about Dantoro's feelings towards Jikantoro. So we cannot conclude whether Dantoro disliked Jikantoro or not.

I heard that The memory of Aubrey's death burnt within Addison, to the point that they couldn't eat or sleep.  And I was wondering What will happen to Addison?

Generated Response:
How is he going to overcome this loss?

A:

He'll have a hard time dealing with it. He probably won't be able to see any reason why his life would not continue in spite of the fact that he's dead.
It's quite possible though that he'll eventually come around and learn to live without him.

Reference Response:
The experience of losing a loved one can be incredibly traumatic and can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being. In the case of Addison, the memory of Aubrey's death has clearly had a significant impact on their ability to function on a day-to-day basis. The fact that they are unable to eat or sleep suggests that they are experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety, which are common reactions to grief.

In the short term, it is likely that Addison will continue to struggle with the aftermath of Aubrey's death. They may experience intense feelings of sadness, guilt, anger, and confusion, and may find it difficult to engage in activities that they once enjoyed. They may also have trouble concentrating, making decisions, and interacting with others.

However, with time and support, it is possible for Addison to begin to heal from their loss. This may involve seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to work through their grief and develop coping strategies. It may also involve leaning on friends and family members for emotional support, and engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or creative pursuits.

Ultimately, the path to healing from grief is a highly individualized process, and there is no one "right" way to navigate it. However, with patience, compassion, and a willingness to seek help when needed, it is possible for Addison to move forward from this difficult experience and find a sense of peace and acceptance.

I'm just glad that they finally got rid of those stupid little hand puppets used by some movies when they're trying to portray animals. This movie tries to do exactly that! It starts off great though. The dinosaurs look awesome and there are lots of special effects which help make everything seem more real than what we've seen before. However after seeing half of the movie I stopped caring if these characters were alive or dead because I couldn't care less anymore. It's kind of funny to hear them talk like humans instead of animal sounds, but then again that's only temporary until we realize their voices aren't human. Somehow the plot gets lost and things go downhill fast. There are plenty of laughs throughout the entire movie, but none could save it from being bad.

Q: Context: "Take That Look Off Your Face" is the title of a hit song by musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Collaborating with lyricist Don Black, it was written for the song cycle show Tell Me on a Sunday in 1978. It was sung and released by Marti Webb in 1980, and became a No. 3 hit in the UK charts. The song was also popular in Ireland, and spent six weeks at number one. Later, Tell Me on a Sunday was combined with another Lloyd Webber work, Variations, to form an entire new show, Song and Dance.

Question: who sang take that look off your face?
Let's give stream of consciousness below

Generated Response:
When I saw this question pop up as tag wiki answer today (and no other answers are tagged), my first thought was:

I think that's taken from "Don't stop 'til you get enough/Don't go breaking down until you've tried"; although I'm not sure which version exactly.
This isn't quite right though; there has been many hits since then using the same lyrics - notably Take My Hand - but none have used them in such a way as part of a larger piece of music or a single composition. In fact it's fair to say they were almost never included outside those contexts. 
But let's suppose we did accept it as correct. What would be most likely? I'd guess you'd find two possible candidates: 

A) A later cover band recording like Sonny & Cher's 1976 take of Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough, which features some reworked lyrics and more modern arrangements, including some additional harmonies. If this was what happened here, we'd need to ask why the original version didn't feature these elements. (It's worth noting that even if someone made a cover of TMLOSFVQDWLRQ QXLVDWHU WRXMRXV D\DQW FRPSDUDEHG OHV EDVVLQJV)
B) Some variant of the original, where the words themselves had been changed slightly and/or rearranged into different orderings - possibly within the context of telling a story about something else. 

A:

(a) A later cover band recording like Sonny & Cher’s 1976 take of “Don’t Stop Till You Get Enough”, which features some reworked lyrics and more modern arrangements, including some additional harmonies.
(b) Some variant of the original, where the words themselves had been changed slightly and/or rearranged into different orderings – possibly within the context of telling a story about something else.

The best bet seems to me #1.  And #2 wouldn't make sense without adding further details.

As noted above, this article provides a good overview of several covers over the years.

In 1979, John Farnham recorded the track with his band The Nightside Orchestra under their own name. They added a chorus line called ‘Take That Look Away’ before dropping out of the studio and letting John record it himself.

Reference Response:
Okay, so the question is "who sang take that look off your face?" Based on the context given, it was sung by Marti Webb in 1980. The song was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Don Black for the song cycle show Tell Me on a Sunday in 1978. It became a No. 3 hit in the UK charts and was also popular in Ireland, spending six weeks at number one. Later, Tell Me on a Sunday was combined with another Lloyd Webber work, Variations, to form an entire new show, Song and Dance. So, to summarize, Marti Webb sang "Take That Look Off Your Face."

How flights decide their route?
How are airline flights routed?

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?

Generated Response:
Or is there some difference between them that I don't know of (or not have experience with)?

A:

The question you tagged as "flights" seems to be asking how airplanes make decisions on where they want to fly. It would seem like a good fit for Aviation Stack Exchange, which has been around since 2011.
On the other hand, your second question asks if airlines can predict when an aircraft will arrive at its destination based off of weather forecasts and historical data. This could be more appropriately asked here, but it depends very much upon what type of predictions you're looking for:
Is it possible to predict arrival times in advance using only past flight information?
In general, aviation related stuff tends to fall into either Aviation SE or Travel SE depending upon whether it's directly relating to flying planes or travel.

Reference Response:
Yes, both questions are asking about the process and considerations involved in determining the paths or routes that airline flights follow. They're about the logistics, rules, and procedures that result in a specific flight path from one place to another. 

Now, answering the question: 

1. **Preparation**: Flight paths are determined by a variety of factors including fuel efficiency, wind direction, the rotation of the earth, and avoiding turbulent weather. Airlines work with a host of specialists like meteorologists, air traffic control, and flight operations to prepare the most efficient and safe flight path.

2. **Planning the Flight Route**: The flight path is usually the straightest possible line between the origin and the destination, not including obstructions or other considerations like no-fly zones. This isn't always a straight line on a map due to the curvature of the earth, and so what appears to be a curved route on a flat map might be the shortest route on a globe. 

3. **Complying with Air Traffic Control (ATC)**: Air Traffic Control (ATC) has regulations and procedures for different air spaces. Airlines must comply with ATC routes, sometimes requiring them to take slightly longer paths to comply with traffic separation rules, or to remain within a safe distance of an airport in case of emergencies.

4. **Weather Considerations**: Airlines also work with meteorologists to try and predict weather patterns on the flight's day and time. They will adjust their flight path to avoid major storms or to take advantage of tailwinds (winds moving in the same direction as the plane) which can save fuel.

5. **Communication with the Pilots**: The planned route, along with any considerations like weather, emergency airports, and no-flys zones, is communicated to the pilots. They will use this information, along with real-time updates from ATC and their own instruments, to make decisions during the flight.

6. **Finalising the Route**: Once these factors are taken into account and the route planned, the final flight plan is logged with the airline, the pilots, and air traffic control. The plan can be altered if unforeseen conditions like unexpected weather arise.

7. **Executing the Route**: Finally, the plane takes off and follows the flight plan. The pilots stay in regular contact with air traffic control and can make alterations to the plan if needed, for safety or efficiency reasons.

This step-by-step process is done to ensure that every flight is safe, efficient, and in compliance with international aviation law and regulations.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who gave up the conductorship of the Purcell Singers in 1967?  Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963.   When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of "persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival. She made her...

The option that is in line with common sense to answer the question "The sun was out and the temperature changing rapidly, it was really beginning to what?" is "heat up". This is because when the sun is out, it emits heat and causes the temperature to rise. Additionally, the phrase "temperature changing rapidly" suggests that the temperature is increasing quickly. Therefore, the correct option is "heat up".

His bosses, fellow workers and relatives all come to console him but end up confiding their own pain and difficulties, surrendering to his incomprehensible calm. Gradually, Pietro begins to look at the world through new eyes. In the end, it is through his love for his daughter that Pietro finds the key to a kind of spiritual rebirth and emerges from this journey with a newfound love of life.
Answer:

Generated Response:
In response to your question, you should explain how the character undergoes change by explaining which event triggers such changes.

A:

I would say that Pietro experiences an emotional transformation as he watches his daughter grow into womanhood (through being responsible enough to take care of herself), while simultaneously watching another young girl die. 
The experience leads to introspection and ultimately inner peace/love. 

This particular storyline was written specifically for children so I am not sure if they will be able to fully grasp its meaning, however it does seem like something that could have been handled more sensitively...

What is the most logical next event?

The man grabs a can from a woman on the inner tube then grabs her right hand and helps her to stand up and the rest of the people start getting out of their inner tubes and stand up while the man helps another woman out of hers. when a woman

pick from the following.
 1). is over the last lip, the man helps her stand up and then pulls her down and she starts to fall down.
 2). is on the inner tube, she begins to sink down behind the skirt of the woman on the inner tube as the driver tries to guide her but she starts falling to the floor.
 3). gets out of her inner tube she has a lot of leaves on her back, a man notices it and he wipes it off of her back with his hands and then he grabs a bottled water and pours it onto her back.
 4). gets out and speaks, other people are also waiting to get out of their inner tubes to work out on inner tubes.

The group takes turns going through each person in order to make sure they are all ok before continuing on.

My problem is that I cannot figure out how exactly this guy would have gotten everyone else's attention since there was no sign or sound coming from them? If you notice anything at all what might be happening?
I am trying my best not to use too much logic because if something seems possible based on logic alone then it's probably impossible. 
If anyone could help me out I'd greatly appreciate it. 

A:

This guy must have noticed some activity within the boat.  He heard someone say "Help", so he grabbed someone's arm to pull them into position.  
There were no external sounds (other than the humming noise) indicating any life support system malfunctioning.  This indicates either:
1.) No one had fallen asleep during the trip;  which implies they're quite healthy, given the fact that they're still alive after 6 hours.
2.) They weren't sleeping.  In such an environment, there's no way for us humans to tell whether we're actually awake or just pretending to be asleep.  So we assume they aren't sleeping; even though many others may find themselves dead already by now.
3.) Their brains have shut down due to lack of oxygen - assuming they've been floating around underwater without breathing air for more than two hours.   A brain injury caused by drowning leads almost always to death in less than three days unless treated immediately.

In your example scenario, the only plausible outcome is #2 above.

He helped a lady who seemed to need assistance pulling herself along inside her inner-tube.  As soon as she's safely pulled towards safety, he looks to see what's happened outside.  (Maybe he's checking to ensure everything is alright, maybe he's looking for help.)  Maybe somebody shouts "HELP!" somewhere near where the injured woman is staying.  

But... if he didn't hear anybody shout HELP?  Isn't that strange?
(Yes, I'm aware that these are hypothetical scenarios, but that's part of learning about things like this -- imagine you're watching a movie playing in a theater and suddenly nobody moves!  It doesn't mean that everybody died instantly, it means that they stayed quiet until you turn the volume up again.)
To clarify further...
It's pretty easy to drown yourself in freshwater.  To drown yourself in saltwater requires very different techniques and equipment, but once you've learned those skills, you'll be able to do both equally well!
So let's take your specific scenario...

A man finds himself sitting on top of an old lady who appears to be struggling to stay upright.  She says

Reference Response:
The most logical next event is:

3). After the woman gets out of her inner tube, she has a lot of leaves on her back. A nice man notices this and helps her by wiping the leaves off of her back with his hands. Then, he grabs a bottled water and pours it onto her back to clean it better. This makes sense because everyone is helping each other and being kind, just like the man who earlier helped the woman stand up.

Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - Commit This to Memory is the second studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was released on June 7, 2005, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, formed in 1997, had first found success with their debut album, "I Am the Movie" (2002). The band toured in the interim years, creating positive word-of-mouth. In 2004, the band joined Blink-182 on the road for a string of shows, which led to their bassist, Mark Hoppus, joining the band in the studio for his first producing effort.  - Adam Schlesinger (born October 31, 1967) is an American songwriter, composer and record producer. He has won Emmy and Grammy Awards, and has also been nominated for Oscar, Tony, and Golden Globe Awards. He is also a winner of the ASCAP Pop Music Award.  - Emo is a loosely categorized rock music genre characterized by expressive, often confessional, lyrics. It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as "emotional hardcore" or "emocore" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. However, as emo was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk encapsulated in the early 1990s by bands such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the , numerous emo acts formed in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged.  - Japan ("Nippon" or "Nihon" ; formally "" or "Nihon-koku", means "State of Japan") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

Ocasek has been married to model Paulina Porizkova since 1989.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea") and South Korea (officially the "Republic of Korea"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - Greenwich Village, often referred to by locals as simply "the Village", is a neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan, New York City. Greenwich Village has been known as an artists' haven, the Bohemian capital, the cradle of the modern LGBT movement, and the East Coast birthplace of both the Beat and '60s counterculture movements. "Groenwijck", one of the Dutch names for the village (meaning "Green District"), was Anglicized to "Greenwich". Two of New York's private colleges, New York University (NYU) and the New School, are located in Greenwich Village.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Even if It Kills Me is the third studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Ric Ocasek, Adam Schlesinger, and Eli Janney, the album was released on September 18, 2007, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, made a breakthrough with their second album, "Commit This to Memory", garnering praise and independent buzz upon its 2005 release. Following the release, the band toured relentlessly over the next two years, during which time frontman Justin Pierre struggled with alcohol and substance abuse. These addictions were infused into the writing process of "Even If Kills Me", which was recorded in early 2007 Stratosphere Studios in Chelsea and the legendary Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village.  - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is "L'Étoile du Nord" (French: "Star of the North"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally "just a logo and a P.O. box" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands.  - Motion City Soundtrack was an American rock band that formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997. The band's line-up consisted of vocalist and guitarist Justin Pierre, lead guitarist Joshua Cain, keyboardist Jesse Johnson, bassist Matthew Taylor, and drummer Tony Thaxton. Over the course of their nearly twenty-year career, the group toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. The band's sound, at times described as pop punk or emo, made notable use of the Moog synthesizer.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.

began to be defined more generally.
- The term “emo” came into popular use around 1990 when some writers described this new generation of emotionally focused bands within the context of “the death of punk.” For example, Chris Bell wrote about how he felt that emo bands were “a natural extension of what [he]’d seen happen to punk over the last few decades”:
Punk had always been there but people didn’t really understand what it meant; they thought it was just another subgenre of heavy metal....I think what’s happening now—even though it’s still going strong—is sort of like the same thing happened at the end of the ’70s: People started saying things like ‘we’ve lost our edge’ because we’re getting so soft and emotional. ...They call us emo, which means something completely different than the way I used to say it before.

Given the question: PAUL Reynolds doodled idly on a bar napkin as he sipped at his margarita. All around him tourists of every size and shape were donning paper pirate hats and plastic eye patches. They were part of a relatively new Key West tradition called the Booty Hunt - a glorified bar crawl where participants followed a "treasure map" that led them from bar to bar, with occasional stops in private homes, and where the chief treasure to be found was the pleasure of being surrounded by fellow drunks and saying "Arrrr" a lot. Paul had participated a few times himself and was kind of embarrassed at how much fun it was. His pen drew a rough sketch of the crowd, although in his version they were actual pirates, in full dress with real swords and pistols and parrots. He took another sip and glanced around the bar, wondering where his drinking companion had gotten to. It was still early - just an hour or so after sunset, and Crooked Pete's was only half full. Located on Simonton, a block off the tourist-choked sidewalks of Duval Street, the bar hadn't hit its stride for the evening yet. The real crowd and the regulars would come later, once they had gotten a bite to eat and were ready for some serious, cheap drinking. He saw his friend Sandee emerge - finally - from the bathroom, smiling at Paul from across the bar while maneuvering through the gaggle of barhopping buccaneers. Thick, cascading black curls complemented Sandee's black sequined mini-dress that clung to every slim curve and emphasized shapely breasts. Sandee winked at one of the tourists, blowing the man a kiss as he ogled in naked admiration. "Did you miss me?" Sandee asked, sitting down beside Paul. "Of course," Paul replied, sliding another margarita to Sandee. "But your drink missed you more. All your ice is melting." "Oh, the poor darlings," Sandee cooed, licking the salt on the rim suggestively before taking a long swallow that emptied a third of the contents.

After completing her training under master Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan made her film debut with “On Shek Kiu” (“White Tiger”) in 1974. After appearing in several martial arts films throughout the 1970s including “The Big Boss”, she became widely known worldwide thanks to such titles as “The Karate Kid”, “Kong Fu: A Legend Reborn” and “Bowling Alone 2”.
Chan’s career has continued unabated ever since – producing critically acclaimed action movies like “Wonder Woman” and “Train To Busan”; establishing herself as both director and star in “Ghost Rider 2: Spirit Of Vengeance” and “Mission Impossible III;” and starring alongside Johnny Depp in the upcoming “Hook” remake. With over 100 films under her belt, Jackie Chan has become synonymous with action cinema.
In addition to acting, Jackie Chan also makes appearances on television shows, performing live concerts and touring internationally. In recent years, however, she has chosen to focus more on her humanitarian endeavors than continuing her successful movie-making career.

Q:The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line.  Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.  In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A?
A:

Generated Response:
Rob should use Newton's second law because it will tell him how much force Earth exerts on rob.

Newton's Second Law:F=ma

Which tells us that the larger the mass, the greater the acceleration.
So I am confused why we need equations when you can just apply basic physics?

A:

For any given pair of bodies, say, the planets Jupiter & Saturn, there exists only one absolute reference frame where their motions are simple enough for them to be described by linear motion.  This means that no amount of calculus could ever help explain what happens in reality. 
If we try to describe the dynamics of those systems using our usual tools then we run into problems like this:  What happens during the approach phase?  How do we deal with cases where both bodies pass perihelion simultaneously?  
There really isn't anything wrong with your example -- it's just not applicable to many real-world scenarios.  
In fact, even though you're asking about relative motion, most people actually assume that all physical laws are valid regardless of whether they're describing changes within a single system or differences among multiple systems.  

What is a vector field?

A function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called a scalar field iff its value depends linearly upon its argument.  That is:
$$f(x_1, ..., x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \cdot x_i + b_1b_2 \dotsb + b_{n-1}$$
where $a_i$ are constants, $b_1$ ... $b_n$ are scalars and $x_1, ... , x_n$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

Why does the velocity change as well? 

Because it's defined in terms of the rate-of-changing-of-position; that's what velocities measure.  If the rate-of-changing-of-velocity was zero everywhere, then the directional derivative would exist so long as the position wasn't changing too quickly (which means you wouldn't see any interesting behavior).
It's important to note here that there's nothing special about rates-of-changes-that-were-measured-within-the-same-system:  Any rate of change that applies to different systems must still be measured in the appropriate units.  (This is easy to understand if you think about how distances scale differently across different coordinate frames.)  

What is a differential equation?

Differential equations express relationships between functions over some domain $D$.  They might look something like: 
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x) = g(t, x) - \alpha h(x), \qquad x\in D$$
or they may be written in terms of partial derivatives such as:
$$\Delta f(x) = \frac{\

Reference Response:
In classical theory, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the mass of each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 

In this scenario, asteroid A and asteroid B have the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the Earth than asteroid B. Since the distance between asteroid A and the Earth is greater than the distance between asteroid B and the Earth, according to classical theory, the gravitational force between the Earth and asteroid B would be stronger than the gravitational force between the Earth and asteroid A. 

Therefore, if Rob needs to find out the object with a stronger gravitational pull according to classical theory, he would choose the Earth.

Claim: "The mass of a Photon can be measured using a weighing scale."
Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?
Options:
- yes
- no Step-by-step reasoning process:

Generated Response:
Define what you mean by "mass"; that is to say, define exactly how much matter or energy a photon has.
In order for the mass of a photon to have any meaning at all, there must also exist some kind of measurement method (i.e., apparatus) which allows one to measure this quantity directly; i.e., something with an electronic device such as a balance beam, etc.

This may seem like overkill since we already know how light interacts in everyday life - namely through refraction/reflection on glass surfaces.  But consider two different kinds of interactions between photons and materials:  

The interaction where a photon passes from vacuum into air;  and  
the interaction where a photon passes from vacuum into water.  

We assume that each type of interaction occurs instantaneously and completely within a single event.  That means when a photon strikes a surface, its wavefront undergoes total internal reflection.  So even though our measuring equipment can't see anything moving inside the water, they will still feel pressure due to the change in refractive index.  
Now if we're going to use a standard optical lens system to view these phenomena experimentally, then clearly the size of the lens aperture would determine the amount of light allowed to pass into the camera sensor.   A small hole lets more light in than does a larger hole because less light bounces off of the sides of the hole itself, but only the portion that gets past the center area contributes towards the image formation.   Thus, given the same number of photons striking the entrance window of the lens, fewer will reach the focal plane of the lens if the aperture diameter is smaller.    This explains why a narrower slit produces sharper images than do wider slits. 
But here comes another thing that's not always considered when designing lenses.   If the width of the aperture is too wide, part of the incoming light actually becomes scattered back out again rather than being focused onto the focal point of the imaging optics.  The "scattered" light isn't absorbed entirely away -- just spread across a larger area.  In fact, the exact pattern depends upon whether the scattering object was close enough to produce strong diffraction effects, or far enough so that it's possible to neglect them altogether.    
(Note that this doesn't apply to very short wavelengths; e.g., visible light.)
So let's now take this concept further and think about things that are outside of ordinary vision.  We saw earlier that light's speed is constant, independent of wavelength.   Therefore, whatever the value of c is for red light, it remains equal regardless of the wavelength.   Similarly,

Reference Response:
No, the claim is not correct and it can be verified without a web search using human common sense. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. A photon is a fundamental particle of light and has no mass according to the Standard Model of particle physics.
2. Weighing scales measure the mass of an object by measuring the force of gravity acting on it.
3. Since photons have no mass, they do not interact with gravity and cannot be weighed using a weighing scale.
4. Therefore, the claim that the mass of a photon can be measured using a weighing scale is incorrect and can be verified without a web search using human common sense.

In summary, the claim is false and can be easily refuted by understanding the properties of photons and how weighing scales work.

Organelles (organismal structures)
Protein 
Ribosome 

From these it should be obvious what you need to know.

Organisms contain different types of compartments or 'organs' that perform specific functions, depending on whether they're intracellular or extracellular. 
These include nuclei with histones for chromatin packaging; vacuoles for storage of substances like sugars and fats; membranes for transporting material around; cytoskeleton for movement; plasma membrane surrounding all other organs; etc. 

To clarify further we might say that there are two main kinds of organelles; structural/structural components, which hold together an organism's structure e.g., skeletal muscle fibres, tendon cells,  blood vessels,   nerve axons, hair follicles,   keratins, cellulose fibrils and starch grains, connective tissue ECM, lens fibre matrix and photoreceptor outer segments; and metabolic/mobile components, which move materials inside or out of the body e.g., enzymes, lipids, ATP, hormones, neurotransmitters, ions, water, waste products, viruses, bacteria, and food particles.  

So yes, the question asks about the content of organelles but not specifically about how they are formed.

Reference Response:
The correct option is ribosomes. Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they are involved in building cellular proteins in the cytoplasm. The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA (called mRNA), into amino acids. Ribosomes are made in the nucleolus and then exported to the cytoplasm, where they direct protein synthesis.

A woman is seen speaking to the camera while sitting in a chair and leads to hear sitting in a shower holding a dog. she

Generated Response:
has her hair washed.
Does this mean that there are two women, one who talks to the camera and another who does not?
Is it just me or do I think they look different from each other? The woman's face seems more 'confused' than hers.

A:

I can imagine several interpretations here.  First of all, it's likely that you were watching TV on VHS (or DVD) rather than Blu-ray.  In both cases, there's no audio track for dialogue but you could still see what was happening at any given moment by looking at the picture.  So if you're seeing something like this:
Man:  Who's going to fix my car?  Oh, let me tell ya!  You know that big guy with the mustache who's always telling everybody he's fixing your cars?  He'll fix your car!
Woman #1 looks up at Man #2 as he walks away towards the back door.
So we can assume that she's talking about Man 2.  But then why isn't she wearing glasses when she speaks?  Isn't that the sort of thing you'd put over your eyes during an interview?  And how did Man 1 get his name down so quickly without having to read anything off paper?
The second possibility is that these images represent the same scene taken under very slightly different lighting conditions and/or different angles.  
The third possibility would be that they're really unrelated shots which happened within the same time frame; although it'd require some editing/retouching to make them appear similar.  I'd say that's unlikely though since there aren't too many similarities between them except maybe their posture and facial expressions, etc.

Reference Response:
then begins to explain her story, providing the context for the unusual setting and situation we've just witnessed. The woman, named Sarah, is a devoted animal lover and advocate who dedicates her life to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in need. The dog she's holding in the shower, whom she has named Oscar, is her latest rescue. This particular scene captures her ongoing efforts to support Oscar's physical and emotional recovery.

Sarah starts by detailing how she came across Oscar, who was found abandoned and in poor health near a local park. Someone had left him without food or water, and suffering from multiple injuries, most likely inflicted by a previous owner. Oscar was in a severe state of shock and fear, barely responsive to human touch. Sarah's mission was to give him a second chance at life by giving him the care, love, and affection he desperately required.

In the video, Sarah discusses the importance of patience and understanding when dealing with traumatized animals. She emphasizes that the first step in rehabilitating any rescued animal is to create a sense of safety and trust. In Oscar's case, this involved introducing him to her home, her other rescued pets, and allowing him to gradually familiarize himself with his new surroundings.

The video then transitions to the scene in the shower, where Sarah explains that she's using this space to help Oscar overcome his fear of water. Abused animals often associate water with negative experiences or punishment, so it's crucial for Sarah to gently encourage Oscar to view water as a source of comfort and cleanliness. By sitting alongside him in the shower and calmly talking to him as she cradles him in her arms, she's providing a nurturing environment in which Oscar can slowly learn to let go of his fears and anxieties.

Throughout the video, Sarah intersperses her own experiences and tips with expert advice from veterinarians and animal behaviorists. This balanced approach highlights the importance of a well-rounded strategy when it comes to the care and rehabilitation of rescued animals like Oscar.

Sarah also emphasizes the value of networking and collaborating with local animal shelters, rescue organizations, and other animal lovers in the community. By working together, these individuals and groups can raise awareness, provide valuable resources, and ultimately create a supportive network to help save the lives of countless animals in need.

Towards the end of the video, Sarah shares updates on Oscar's progress. With time, love, patience, and proper care, he has slowly started to trust humans again and is beginning to play with Sarah's other pets. His physical wounds are healing, and he's becoming more comfortable and at ease in his environment.

By sharing her experiences and providing helpful advice on how to care for and rehabilitate rescued animals, Sarah aims to inspire others to take action, get involved and make a difference in the lives of abandoned, abused, or neglected animals. Through her video and ongoing advocacy efforts, she hopes to create a more compassionate world where animals like Oscar can find a safe haven and a loving home.

In conclusion, the story that most naturally follows the initial scene of a woman sitting in a chair leading to her sitting in a shower holding a dog is one of hope, love, and transformation. It is a journey in which Sarah helps Oscar overcome his past traumas and rediscover the joy and beauty of life with the support of a caring human companion and a nurturing environment.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Until I saw this recently on TCM, I'd never heard of it: the youngest of a staid Edwardian England family is expelled from a Royal Navy prep school for stealing; father goes thru extraordinary lengths to clear his son's name. English actor Robert Donat was a heartthrob of the period: he portrays barrister (English version of our litigator or trial lawyer) Sir Robert Morton, an expensive, what-we'd-call corporate attorney; after several false starts, including a debate in the House of Commons (over what in English law was basically a lawsuit against the Crown), Sir Robert accepts the case.The centerpiece here is Sir Robert's interrogation of young Ronnie, the defendant, in the boy's home, in front of his rapidly deteriorating father & antagonistic, suffragette sister. Sir Robert's battery of questions quickly turns into an 18-K cross-examination, the kind he knows the boy can expect in court, over vehement objections from his family. Meanwhile, the case & the Winslow family become objects of public ridicule & derision.Also interesting are the ways family members change: in the beginning, Pop Winslow (played with Cedric Hardwicke's usual aplomb) seems the most value-rigid & proper fish in a sea of rebels (Lindy Hops, cigarets); gradually, it's pop that must convince even feminist daugher Katy to stay the course.

Unknown to his unconscious wife, Katherine (Julia Stiles), Robert adopts an orphaned newborn at the suggestion of the hospital's Catholic priest, Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice). Naming him Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), Robert and Katherine raise the boy. Robert's career ascends over the course of the next five years. He is named Deputy Ambassador to the Court of St. James in the United Kingdom. Following the death of the previous ambassador, Robert assumes his position and settles in a large estate just outside London. However, disturbing events begin to occur, including the suicide of Damien's nanny at his birthday party. Robert is approached by Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), who claims to have been involved with events surrounding Damien's birth. Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings (David Thewlis) finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious omens, including premonitions of people's deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow), is hired. Tension rises when Mrs. Baylock starts to make decisions without the consent of the Thorns, including adopting a Rottweiler for Damien's protection. Following an incident near a chapel in which Damien attacks Katherine, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about her son, one of these involving a red-hooded jackal skeleton. When the Thorns visit a zoo, the animals react violently at the sight of Damien. Katherine begins to wonder if there is something wrong with Damien. Father Brennan confronts Robert, telling him that Damien's mother was a jackal, and that the boy is the Antichrist. He explains that Damien must die and a man called Bugenhagen (Michael Gambon), located in Megiddo, can assist. After being rebuked, Father Brennan is killed during a lightning storm.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. Question: What does the author want to happen to her skin? Answer:

Generated Response:
My current routine includes cleansing twice daily using gentle soap-free cleanser followed by toner and moisturiser.
I apply sunscreen every day no matter what time of year it's in. (Sunscreens protect our health - not only against UV rays but also pollution.) So far, nothing too drastic has happened yet!
However, there may well be more changes coming soon!!! (I've got another product to try!)
In conclusion, I feel very happy having used the Acne Pack for about two weeks now, and am seeing some improvements already. Some of my most noticeable results include less breakouts appearing around the mouth area and under the nose, fewer redness/papules/granulations etc.. However, overall I'd say that this doesn't seem to offer any real 'clearing' benefits, although I certainly don't expect miracles either. Maybe I'll keep putting my faith in them though and give it a few months before reporting back again :-)
What do you guys think? Do you use anything similar? Any other recommendations?

This article: Axelrod's music was also rediscovered and sampled by leading disc jockeys in the 1990s including hip hop producers. When sampling in hip hop peaked during the early and mid-1990s, they searched for archived records with atmospheric beats and strings to sample. Los Angeles-based disc jockey B+ recalled finding a copy of Song of Innocence at a Goodwill in Culver City and said it appealed to him because of its dissonant quality, musical dynamics, and string sound: "This big sound. It was like somehow [Axelrod] was summoning the future, that you can project this environment, this moment into the future." Electronica pioneers such as DJ Cam and DJ Shadow also sampled Song of Innocence. The latter producer sampled the record's choral themes and piano motifs on his influential debut album Endtroducing..... (1996). "The Smile" was sampled by Pete Rock on his 1998 song "Strange Fruit" and by DJ Premier on Royce da 5'9"'s 2009 song "Shake This". "Holy Thursday" was frequently sampled by producers, including The Beatnuts on their 1994 song "Hit Me with That", UNKLE on their 1998 song "Rabbit in Your Headlights", and Swizz Beatz on Lil Wayne's 2008 song "Dr. Carter".The renewed interest in Axelrod's work prompted Stateside Records to reissue Song of Innocence in 2000. Reviewing the re-release, Now wrote that after sounding odd during the 1960s, the songs had become "a sampler's dream come true – who knew?" David Keenan attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy to "the original badass drummer" Palmer. In his appraisal for The Wire, he facetiously critiqued that the songs "may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern." Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey later said Axelrod's first two records were "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having "literally been a rap producer's delight for years". In a 2013 list for Complex, DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named "Holy Thursday" the greatest hip hop sample of all time.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who critiqued that the songs "may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern?", what is it ?

Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie, a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce.

Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie.

I am looking forward to this movie so much because i love romance movies ,i think it's great . I hope you'll like my review
My name is Alyssa, I'm 15 years old. I've been watching many tv series over the past few months and decided to write my first review. This film was not bad really, although there were parts that could've used improvement. Some things didn't make sense (for example why did Wilson call Maura a whore?) however, overall this film was good.
The main character had strong acting skills - she made me feel sad when she cried, happy when she laughed etc., all emotions felt real! She also acted well throughout the whole story!
All scenes were interesting; sometimes you would laugh out loud then cry again. In fact I cried most times during the last part of the movie where we see how close the couple become despite everything going against them.
Sophie and Maura looked alike especially when they wore black clothing or makeup. I liked seeing those moments between the characters. They look alike even though they're different people!
Overall, I'd recommend watching this movie if you're into romantic comedy/drama stories because these types of films can help us appreciate others more.
Watched this movie today. Overall pretty decent movie except maybe the end.... But still worth watching!!! Love your writing style, continue!!!

Ronald Soza returned home to find U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents waiting for him at his doorstep. Soza, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, was taken to a detention center. When the teens -- both legal residents -- came home to an empty house at the end of the day, they realized something was very wrong. Then the phone rang. It was their father, trying to reassure them that everything would be OK.

Ronald's son said.
After learning about his father's arrest, he rushed back to school but couldn't make it into class because no one answered the door. He asked around, found out where ICE agents were holding his dad, called police on his cellphone and went to get help. 
"He didn't show up after we got there"
said Ronald's daughter. "I can't believe my father could do this to us. I'm scared to death right now. It's not fair. Why did you have to take away our mommy?"
When the teenagers finally saw their father, all eyes turned toward him as if expecting some kind of explanation or apology. Instead, Ronald just kept walking.
The two children sat down with CNN reporter Sarah McBride. The younger child wanted nothing more than to hug her father; she begged: "Daddy! Don't leave me alone! Daddy! Stay! Please stay!"

A:

This answer has been accepted by @Clementine, who pointed out the use of the verb "to come home" instead of "go home".  However, I think it's still worth explaining why the choice of words mattered.  
In order to fully understand how these sentences differ, let's look closely at each sentence individually. 

They came home from school to find their father missing.

First things first--we need to figure out whether "they" are talking about themselves or someone else.  

If they say "This morning I woke up early and decided to go jogging before work. Afterward, I ran across my neighborhood and ended up coming home late", then we can assume they're speaking directly to you. In English, the pronoun "me" always refers to the speaker/author, regardless of whether we're referring to ourselves or another person.   
So that's what we'd expect here: 

I woke up early and decided to go jogging before work.
  *Afterward, I ran across my neighborhood and ended up going home late
  *After running across my neighborhood, I ran back home  

However, if we switch to Spanish, there's absolutely no way we'll ever tell which language you're using without context.  
 
I'm not sure exactly what's happening here, but the best guess I've made thus far is:

Me desperté temprano y decidí salir a correr antes de ir al trabajo.
   Después, corrí por mi barrio para volver tarde
   Después de haber corrido por el barrio volví a casa  

As long as we keep reading, we'll

Reference Response:
any other home," Cesia said. "I don't know any other country. I don't know any other language. This is my home. This is where I grew up. This is where my family is."

The family's situation is not unique. According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, many of whom have lived in the country for years and have established families and communities. The Trump administration has taken a hardline stance on immigration, with ICE agents ramping up arrests and deportations.

The Soza family is now facing an uncertain future. Without their father, they are struggling to make ends meet and are unsure of what will happen next. They are not alone in their struggle, as many families are torn apart by immigration policies that prioritize deportation over family unity.

Advocates for immigration reform are calling for a more compassionate approach to immigration policy, one that takes into account the human cost of separating families. They argue that the United States should provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for years and have established roots in their communities.

As for the Soza family, they are holding onto hope that their father will be released and allowed to return home. In the meantime, they are relying on the support of their community and the strength of their family bond to get through this difficult time.

Eytan Fox, whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful film, "Yossi & Jagger". In "The Bubble", however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme.

Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people at the screening I attended quietly got up and left. I also quietly left, fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying, and racist bullying (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that Arabs are so wronged by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided Israeli aggression against them, and that they, therefore, should not be held responsible for their actions.

This film wasn't worth the money I paid for the ticket (indeed, I considered demanding my money back), and was basically an Israeli apeing of the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then by all means watch this film, as it really justifies just such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a crying shame. Indeed, just how Israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah State when Israelis themselves make such anti-Israel propaganda, beggars belief.

What a shameful, horrid little film!

Detailed Instructions: You will be given a trivia clue, and the category it belongs to. You should answer with the best answer that belongs in the category and is described by the clue. For consistency, answers should be in all lower cased letters.
Problem:Category: BEER BASH! 
Clue: Maccabee is one of this country's most popular beers
Solution:

Generated Response:
MacCABEEs

A:

Here are my thoughts:

 If you read through what the categories mean (from left to right), they are: 

 1) Beer - A liquid made from fermenting malt or barley. 

 2) Wine - A fruit juice produced when grapes undergo fermentation.

 3) Liquor - Alcoholic drinks such as whisky and vodka.  

 4) Spirit - An alcoholic drink usually distilled.

 5) Other - Anything else!

If we look at each of these closely,

 Beer: This includes beer that comes from many different types of grains.  It can also include those that come from animals or plants.  So any non-alcoholic beverages that contain grain-based ingredients like rice would fall under here.

 Win: This refers mostly to wine but some other alcoholic spirits like whiskey, brandy etc could possibly be included.  Some people call liquors like bourbon "whisky" but I don't think that's true so I'm going to leave them out for now.  
 Lit: While there aren't too many things which go into making liquor, a few do like fruits and herbs.  It's an easy way to get someone drunk without actually having them swallow anything!  Liquors like cognac and tequila often have their own names and labels but if they're not labeled properly then it's hard to tell whether something falls within the category.  Most spirit brands won't mention if it's whisky, rum, brandy, vodka... just say "spirit brand".

 Spirits: The vast majority of products listed under this list seem to be called whiskeys, vodkas, scotches, gin & tonics, martinis....  These are mainly distillates where water has been removed during production.  They may have flavors added to them afterwards; however they still tend to have quite strong flavor profiles regardless of how much sugar was used in the original process.   Many companies use color additives and/or sweeteners to mask certain tastes so even though they might appear to taste similar to another product on the label,  there's no telling exactly what's inside until you've tried both versions.  There are plenty of examples of this type of thing online; try searching "cognac vs tequila" or "gin vs whiskey" and you'll see why I didn't want to put anyone's life in danger trying to figure out these kinds of questions.

Other: Things like sodas, soft drinks, juices, hot chocolate, coffee, tea, soda pop, lemonade, bottled waters, sparkling wines, champagne

Prompt:
Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which test would see less forceful collisions of molecules, case A or case B?  David was trying to see how steam engines work. For that, he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A, he used low temperature. On the other hand, in test B, he used high temperature. David started thinking about how he could use the results of his tests in everyday life.  Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.
The answer to this question is:

Generated Response:
Case A: Low Temperature: Pressure will increase as collision rate decreases because there are fewer collisions per unit time. (see above)
Case B: High Temperature: Pressure will decrease as collision rate increases because there are more collisions per unit time.

A:

If you assume that molecular motion is ergodic then both cases should produce equal pressures since they give rise to exactly the same number of collisions. 
However if you assume that the mean free path between successive collisions varies from one situation to another depending upon whether it is small or large compared to the diameter of your sample then this argument fails.  
In particular for very dilute gases where $\Delta v$ is large relative to $1/v_0$ , i.e., if the velocity distribution is narrowly peaked around $v_0$ , then we can approximate 
$$\int dV \ ~ = \int \frac{d^3 r}{3} \left( \frac{\pi}6\right)^{1/2}\frac{\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T}{\Delta v}$$
(where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is absolute temperature). 
We need not worry too much about what happens near the centre of mass of the molecule; indeed any attempt to do so may seem pointless but I am sure that even if such calculations prove unsuccessful we shall be able to find some qualitative explanation of why the behaviour observed experimentally is consistent with our assumption. 

A:

As @Niall says, these two experiments are different ways of measuring the amount of heat carried away by gas particles in each experiment. If they measure the difference in the temperatures then they won't agree in all situations - e.g. when there's only little friction involved between the particle and the wall. But the actual values measured shouldn't change regardless which way you're looking at them - just their interpretation depends on your assumptions.

Reference Response:
Test A would see less forceful collisions of molecules compared to Test B. This is because in Test A, David used low temperature which would result in lower kinetic energy of gas molecules and less forceful collisions with the walls of the container. In contrast, in Test B, David used high temperature which would result in higher kinetic energy of gas molecules and more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, leading to a higher pressure of the gas.

Write the word that comes to your mind as soon as you think of this picture.
Read it out loud and say what you wrote (or just write it down). You will find some good ideas for writing sentences!
This is a very useful exercise, because by using these pictures you can easily see how people speak or write in different languages!

Reference Response:
Step 1: Choose a subject for the sentence.
I decide to write a sentence about a dog because dogs are a common and relatable subject for most people.

Step 2: Determine the verb or action.
To create an engaging sentence, I want to choose an action that the dog will perform. I decide on "chasing" because it's an active verb that shows the dog's playful nature.

Step 3: Select an object or focus of the action.
I need an object or focus for the action of chasing to complete the sentence. I choose "a butterfly," as it creates a vivid image and adds some playful context to the sentence.

Step 4: Consider adding any additional elements for clarity or detail.
To make the sentence more interesting, I can add an adverb to describe how the dog is chasing the butterfly. I choose "excitedly" to emphasize the dog's enthusiasm.

Step 5: Combine the elements into a complete sentence.
With all the elements selected, I can now create a complete sentence: "The dog excitedly chased a butterfly."

Step 6: Review the sentence for grammar and punctuation.
I re-read the sentence to ensure it is grammatically correct and properly punctuated. The sentence appears to be correct, so the task is complete.

Prompt:
Here is a premise: "A brown and white dog on the beach."

Here is a hypothesis: "Two dogs are playing with each other."

.Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?

Generated Response:
Or does it say that we should test for truth?

A:

In order to answer this, you have to look at what "relates" means in logic. 
A proposition can be thought of as being either true or false. In this case, if your statement was 

"A brown and white dog on the beach." 

then its truth value would be: 
$$
\neg(\text{not} \ & \text{true}\ ) \\
= (1) \wedge (2)
$$
where $1 = A_{brown}$ and $2=A_{white}$.
Now let's consider some different statements. 

$\text{Two }a$s relate to $1$ iff $\text{two }a$s are equal.

This says that two $a$'s will always relate to one another if they are the same thing. For example,

$a=a$b relates to $a=b$ because these expressions both evaluate to $a=b$.

The relationship between an expression $x=y$ and $z=x$ is: $x=y\leftrightarrow z=x$, where $lefthand-side$ refers to an antecedent and $right-hand side$ refers to a consequent.

If $c\in A$ then $A+c \in A$

What this basically tells us is that $A$ contains all possible combinations of elements from itself plus anything else. If $c$ is something which exists within $A$, then adding $c$ to $A$ results in more things existing within $A$. This doesn't mean that any particular element of $A$ has been added, just that every single object which existed previously also now exists after adding $c$.  

For example: $$x=1+3+2x^2+2y^3$$ We know that $$1+3+x^4=0\\ 3x+x^2+y^5=2x^3+xy^2+z^5$$ The first line states that $x$ must exist when there is 1 present. However, since $3x+x^2+y^5=0$ implies that no matter how many times $y$ appears, there cannot possibly be x present twice. Similarly, the second line indicates that once y is present, there can't possibly be two occurrences of x. Therefore, only one occurrence of x could ever occur in combination with three instances of y. (or vice versa)

But I'm not sure about this one... I don't understand exactly what you're trying to ask here...

You asked about "if you had a black and white puppy and a greyhound in the yard, who were you going to notice most easily?"

Reference Response:
No, the premise "A brown and white dog on the beach" does not provide any information about whether the hypothesis "Two dogs are playing with each other" is true or false. The premise only describes the presence of a single dog on the beach, and does not provide any information about other dogs or their behavior. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis based on the given premise alone. We would need additional information or evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.

SEOUL — This week’s summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, to be held on Friday, April 27, is expected to produce a denuclearization framework that U.S. President Donald Trump could support when he meets with Kim in May or June. The North’s reassuring outreach of late, including its decision to unilaterally suspend all nuclear and missile tests, has set an optimistic tone that a deal can be reached. But it is still unclear if real progress toward peace can be achieved. There have been two past inter-Korean Summits in 2000 and 2007, both held in the North. The first produced a joint peace declaration promoting humanitarian exchanges and economic cooperation. From the second came support for a permanent peace treaty and a U.S. and China-led deal to end Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program for economic assistance and security guarantees. However, North Korea’s continued nuclear development efforts and missile tests, in violation of past agreements, and other hostile acts, including a alleged deadly attack on a South Korean naval ship in 2010, brought an end to any progress made at these summits. Leading up to this week’s inter-Korean summit, there are encouraging developments that a nuclear deal may again be within reach. U.S. President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign, that led efforts to impose harsh international sanctions ending most North Korean exports, are exerting increasing economic pain that could be pressuring the leadership in Pyongyang to actually give up its nuclear arsenal this time. "If the situation continues, the foreign exchange could be depleted and North Korea can face a very serious situation at the end of this year. This is one of the reasons why it has come out in favor of dialogue," said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made a number of concessions already by agreeing to talk about denuclearization without conditions, by appearing to drop past...

Sentence: Musical Artist, Aleksandra Kovač is associated with fellow musical artist Kristina Kovač.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?

Generated Response:
How should I use the information to find a specific person?

A:

You need two things for this:
First of all you have to know how many artists there are in your corpus. This will help to make sure that you're not running out of memory while doing processing on large corpora.
Second, you'll want to know which of them are related and who they are linked to:
(1) Counting number of entities
Let's assume we have the following table containing names (e.g., people or companies) in English language as follows:
| id | name             |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | John Doe         | 
|  2  | Mary Smith      | 
|  3  | Joe Bloggs      | 

(2) Extracting relationships between pairs of entity types
Now let's take a look at some relationships:
| relation_id |  source_entity_type  |  target_entity_type |
-------------------------------------
|  1         |   Person        |   Company       |
|  2         |   Musician     |   Composer      |
|  3         |   Singer       |   Songwriter    |
-------------------------------------

(3) Mapping relations to IDs
Finally, we'll map those ids back into our original table:
| relation_id |  source_entity_id  |  target_entity_id  |
-------------------------------------------------
|  1         |   1              |   2           |
|  2         |   1              |   3           |
|  3         |   1              |   4           |

Reference Response:
From the given sentence, we can extract several pieces of information about the musical artist Aleksandra Kovač and her association with fellow musical artist Kristina Kovač. 

Firstly, we can infer that Aleksandra Kovač is a musical artist herself. This suggests that she is involved in the creation and performance of music, and likely has a career in the music industry. 

Secondly, we can see that Aleksandra Kovač is associated with Kristina Kovač, who is also a musical artist. This suggests that the two artists have some kind of professional or personal relationship, and may have worked together in the past or currently collaborate on music projects. 

It is also worth noting that the two artists share the same last name, which could indicate that they are related in some way, such as being siblings or cousins. 

Overall, this sentence provides some basic information about Aleksandra Kovač and her connection to Kristina Kovač, but more details would be needed to fully understand the nature of their association and their respective careers in the music industry.

Premise: Agency policy must assign accountability for recording and maintaining T 

Hypothesis: No one has to record and maintain minutes of the meetings.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?

Available options:
(A). yes
(B). it is not possible to tell
(C). no

Generated Response:
, there are two possibilities (not both)
(D). maybe
I am sure that A is correct.
Why?
My reasoning is as follows:

No agent can be responsible only by himself. So if I were in charge of recording all meeting minutes then my boss would also have to do so too. But this seems impossible because a) the person who records the meeting does not necessarily know everything about it; b) he cannot always get information from everyone; c) some people might forget or misinterpret what was said during the meeting; d) someone else may take notes on his behalf. 
So even though each agent could decide how much detail should go into their notes - which they themselves would keep private - it appears that there will be at least 2 types of agents with different views of what constitutes good/accurate information: those keeping detailed notes and others doing less than full details. 

Is this analysis correct? If so why?
(For reference here is an example of such "agreement" between participants regarding minimal level of detail in a document)

A:

(This answer comes directly out of experience, rather than having read any formalized argumentation.)
The premises seem fine.  The implication is false: you don't need an agreement among the members of your organization before you can say "if X is true, Y is also true; therefore Z is true".
What you're saying is: "We can't know whether our agency's policies actually work until we see them put to use."  That's reasonable enough; but that's not what you're really asking.  What you're asking is this: "Can we trust that these policies work when they're used?  Isn't something wrong going on?"
There isn't anything inherently wrong with that question.  It sounds like you're worried that the fact that you've agreed on certain standards makes you think that they'll work; but that doesn't mean it's right.  In other words, there's nothing inherent in being able to agree on standard operating procedures that means that things won't break down. (In practice, however, we've found that agencies often try to make agreements because they're afraid that they won't agree.)
You can argue either way--both sides are equally plausible.  However, since we're talking about the truth value of statements made in situations involving human beings, I'll assume the latter position here: namely, that whenever humans act according to rules, mistakes happen.  (I'm assuming that, given appropriate conditions, computers behave correctly.)  This assumption leads me to conclude that, although it's probably better for organizations to set up systems to ensure compliance with their own guidelines, it's never entirely guaranteed that you'll get exactly what's specified.
One final point

Reference Response:
(B) It is not possible to tell. 

The premise only states that agency policy must assign accountability for recording and maintaining minutes of the meetings. It does not provide any information about whether or not anyone is actually assigned to do so. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the given premise alone.

Reference Response:
To solve for f in the equation f + 140 = 141, we need to isolate f on one side of the equation. 

First, we can subtract 140 from both sides of the equation to get:

f + 140 - 140 = 141 - 140

Simplifying this gives us:

f = 1

Therefore, the solution to the equation f + 140 = 141 for f is f = 1.

This requires that all universities, colleges, and other educational institutions provide students with opportunities for lifelong learning.
The University should encourage its faculty members to continue their professional development through continuing medical education (CME) in order to improve patient outcomes. The CME activities offered by the university or college could include conferences; workshops; seminars; and clinical practicums at hospitals and/or clinics throughout the country.
I am writing this letter on behalf of my daughter who is currently enrolled at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center – El Paso as an undergraduate nursing student. Her major area of interest involves research into breast cancer screening and prevention strategies among African American women. She has been working diligently towards her degree which includes both classroom work and fieldwork experience. In addition she volunteers regularly at local community centers where she provides assistance to those individuals suffering from substance abuse issues.
She recently completed two separate internships involving gynecologic oncology and pediatric hematology/oncology respectively. During these experiences she worked closely with doctors and nurses specializing in various fields of medicine including obstetrics/gynecology, nephrology, hematology/oncology, genetics, radiology, pathology and psychiatry. My daughter also participated actively in numerous laboratory studies designed to evaluate new treatments against specific types of cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, melanomas, brain tumors, etc…My child was able to gain hands-on practical knowledge in multiple areas of biomedical science while developing excellent interpersonal skills during each period of training. I want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Deaton and his entire staff for providing my child with valuable information regarding future career possibilities.
During our visit to New Orleans we were fortunate enough to tour some wonderful facilities managed by Baylor College of Medicine’s Robert W. Woodruff School of Public Health. We visited three sites: Medical Center Research Institute (MCRI), Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSUHSC), and the University of Southern Mississippi Medical Center (USMMC). MCRI houses a large variety of laboratories devoted to studying infectious diseases. They have established partnerships with public schools located across south central Louisiana enabling them to recruit high school students interested in becoming involved in basic biological sciences research projects conducted within the labs. One example of how they are utilizing “students” would involve offering summer programs at campuses around town teaching young people about microbiological techniques. These camps offer a unique opportunity allowing youths to learn firsthand what it means to conduct scientific investigations using real life

I fail to see a reason for this store to even exist.  Item selection in this store is sporadic, poor, the quality can not be attested to and the prices are completely arbitrary.  The store it self has a dirty and temporary feel to it. The crowd that this store attacks is also less than savory.  The store seems out of place in this neighborhood and has little use to me. Other than looking for Halloween costume crap I would not recommend stopping in here.
How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?
Possible answers: A). negative; B). positive;

Generated Response:
C) neutral.

A:

The answer depends on how you define "negative" or "savory"; but most people have no idea what they mean. 
For instance, if someone asks you why your opinion was negative about something - you're going to say it's because they're rude? Or you're just not very happy with their product/service?  Or maybe you're angry at them? 
If you find yourself saying things like "I hate X company! They're disgusting!! They sucked up my money!!!" then you'd probably consider that as being negatively critical, so yes, that's negative (assuming there's some underlying anger there).
So let's look at the actual description of the store itself: 

It's an antique shop run by two older guys who don't seem too fond
  of each other. You get a crummy coffee cup with a funny logo
  (unrelated to anything), all kinds of cheap junk from China,
  Japan, etc., along with random stuff they've found lying around.
  It's hard to tell exactly what's worth buying, since everything's
  sold per item. 

As far as I'm concerned, anytime one person says "This guy looks great... He's got a nice smile! Let's go meet him! He makes good coffee!" I'd call that pretty positive.  
On the other hand, if someone were telling you "You should stay away from this guy -- he's terrible, he doesn't care about his customers, he only gives bad service, blah blah blah. This isn't a big deal, but we need to think long term..."  Then I'd definitely consider those words as negative, based on your experience. 
You could argue that these comments aren't really about a particular business or individual, so they wouldn't make much sense to describe in such way. But generally speaking, when people write reviews online, it's almost always related to specific businesses / individuals. So unless you've never been to Antique Junkie before, I doubt they'd understand the whole thing without seeing pictures first.

Reference Response:
A) negative.
